## What we are going to cover?

1.  Business Cases & Technical Goals
2.  Technical Toolkit
3.  The Build Process

## Goals

### Business

*   Technicians that maintain remote solar panel installations
*   Newspage Managers that edit content while commuting
*   Students with confined data limits


### Technical

*   Offline capable
*   View all the content, all the time!
*   Drupal to JS, without middleware

## Tools

### Drupal 8

*   Composer for dependency management
*   "Fast by default"
*   Required modules do not exist for D7
    1.  [relaxed](http://dgo.to/relaxed)
    2.  [deploy](http://dgo.to/multiversion)
    3.  [multiversion](http://dgo.to/multiversion)

# Because it's 2016




### React

*   Designed for ‚Äúbuilding large applications with data that changes over time‚Äù
*   Composable Declarative Components
*   Proven to work well with Drupal 8




### pouchDB/couchDB

*   [Offline-first development](http://offlinefirst.org/) ‚âÉ mobile-first development
*   All content is available, all the time. No cold caches!
*   Content conflicts are elegantly handled
*   Very user friendly, very browser friendly, very friendly. üòä




### pouchDB Setup

```
var localDB  = new PouchDB('pouchDBInstance');
var remoteDB = new PouchDB('http://couch/db/instance');

localDB.sync(remoteDB).on('complete', function () {
  // sync success :)
}).on('error', function (err) {
  // 'sync error :(
});

```







## The Build Process




### Build Drupal & Friends




### Configure Relaxed




### Create React App





## Afterthoughts

*   How secure is Relaxed?
*   Is Relaxed preferable over custom controllers?
*   How feasible is pouchDB in production?




## Looking Forward

*   Let the CMS do what it does best
*   Build native with CouchDB for [Android and iOS](https://pouchdb.com/faq.html#native_support)
*   Unleash your front-end devs!
